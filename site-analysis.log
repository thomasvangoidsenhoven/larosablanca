courses: (about me)

  Hello to all
  my name is Denys.
  I always belong to the world of dance, in fact I am a teacher of Caribbean dance (salsa,
  merengue, bachata and other Latin American dances) La Rosa Blanca Dance School
  located in Ravenna and Faenza.
  When Zumba was born I was immediately attracted to this new discipline, knowing I can combine it
  my music and my dances in fitness I had found a great idea.
  I'm talking about my "dances" and "my" music because I had forgotten to tell you that I was born in Cuba.
  In my country, music and dance are an integral part of our traditional culture, I am pure
  fun and Zumba is just this: physical and mental training and wellbeing.
  In Zumba you do not have to have a partner or know how to dance, you just have to
  follow my directions and repeat what I do.
  At the end of the lesson you will be relaxed and without thought ...
  I invite everyone to attend my courses to personally check out what I say, so ...
